			<h1>How We Met</h1>
			<p>Connor and I met in high school, when Connor and his family moved to Waunakee in 2010. We were in the same friend group and got to know each other very well through a cabin trip their senior year. Connor claims he always thought I was cute. I had a lame boyfriend at the time, so I didn’t pay much attention. A few years went by and I found myself single and back in Waunakee for the summer while working at the Aldo Leopold Nature Center. During that time Connor and I began to spend a lot more time together, and started to see each other frequently. On halloween night we kissed and I left him with the romantic words of “don’t make this weird”. But he did make it weird, and I am glad he did. Connor and I send more intentional time together, realizing that we had a lot in common and were a pretty good fit. Around January of 2014 we officially started dating. We had a long distance relationship while I was in school at the University of Wisconsin- Stevens Point and Connor was in Madison working. Connor decided to spend a year up in Stevens Point while attending Mid State Technical College for business. We made a lot of great friends that year, and learned what it was like to be a couple living in the same area. The following year, this year, Connor returned to Madison to work full time and I am finishing up my final year in school.</p>
			<p>On December 10th I was in town visiting for the weekend. Connor said he wanted to spend some time together and he took me out to Indian Lake Park to go for a walk and get some pictures. It was an absolutely gorgeous day, and the recent snowfall covered the landscape in a nice fresh blanket of white. I enjoyed our walk with a slight awareness that this might be the moment. When he set up the camera to take the picture we posed and the picture happend like normal. This threw me off my guard, thinking, oh well it is just a picture then. We took one more, turned out pretty similar to the first. On the third picture he got down on one knee and showed me the ring and asked me to be his wife. I of course cried, and said yes!! We are so excited to spend the rest of our lives together and are so happy that you can join us in celebrating our day! </p>
