			<h1>Connor</h1>
			<p>Hey, I’m Connor. I currently work as the manager and lead cook for Papino’s restaurant and will be taking on a new position at Salvatore's restaurant making their dough and cooking. I love making food and specifically pizza, and I hope to own my own restaurant one day. Outside of cooking I enjoy going rock climbing, connecting with friends through video games and snowboarding. I love winter and being outside in the snow. I love tinkering and home improvement projects. But most of all I enjoy relaxing, drinking a beer and spending time with friends and family.</p>
			<h1>Courtney</h1>
			<p>Hi so glad you all can make it to our wedding! I am currently a student at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point studying wildlife ecology research and management, with minors in environmental education and interpretation and captive wildlife management. I love being outside and enjoying nature, and someday hope to spread my passion for wildlife onto the next generation. I love learning and specifically learning about birds. I am actively involved in the campus ministry of cru and really enjoy singing and leading worship and I’ve gotten to do some pretty incredible things through worship leading, including spend my last 3 spring breaks in Panama City Beach, Florida. I love going rock climbing and I currently work as the manager of the UWSP climbing wall, and lead instructor of the kids climbing program. I am a caffeine addict, and love making and drinking coffee as I am also a barista at the Basement Brewhaus.</p>

			<h1>How We Met</h1>
			<p>Connor and I met in high school when Connor and his family moved to Waunakee in 2010. We were in the same friend group and got to know each other very well through a cabin trip our senior year. A few years went by and I found myself single and back in Waunakee for the summer while working at the Aldo Leopold Nature Center. During that time, Connor and I began to spend a lot more time together and started to see each other frequently. On Halloween night, we kissed and I left him with the romantic words of “don’t make this weird”. But he did make it weird and I am glad he did. Connor and I began to spend more intentional time together and realizing that we had a lot in common and were a pretty good fit.</p>
			<p>Around January of 2015, we officially started dating. We had a long distance relationship while I was in school at the University of Wisconsin- Stevens Point and Connor was in Madison working. In 2016, Connor decided to spend a year in Stevens Point while attending Mid State Technical College for business. We made a lot of great friends that year and learned what it was like to be a couple living in the same area. This year, Connor returned to Madison to work full time while I finished up my final year at University.</p>
			<p>On December 10th, while home for the weekend, Connor said he wanted to spend some time together and go for a walk at Indian Lake Park to take some pictures. It was an absolutely gorgeous day with a recent snowfall covering the landscape in a nice fresh blanket of white. I enjoyed our walk with a slight awareness that this might be ‘the moment’. When he set up the camera to take the picture, we posed and the camera flashed like normal. This threw me off my guard and I began thinking; ‘oh well it is just normal picture’. We took one more picture that turned out pretty similar to the first. On the third picture, he got down on one knee presenting me with the ring and asked me to be his wife. I said yes, through some happy tears. We are so excited to spend the rest of our lives together and are so happy that you can join us in celebrating our day!</p>
